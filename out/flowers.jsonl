This new flower can be any of the two original colors, or a special hybrid color. Note that in order for this to happen, you need to water the flowers.\n\nTo maximize the chance of new flowers appearing, you should plant your flowers in a checkerboard pattern. This ensures the flowers are touching with many other flowers, while still leaving enough space for offspring to appear in.\n\nBlue roses can only appear from \"hybrid\" red or orange roses. These hybrid variants of the original colors look identical to the ones you can buy in the shop, so it may be hard to know whether they are a hybrid variant or not. This is easier to discover when planting your flowers in the checkerboard pattern discussed above.\n\nYou can only get gold roses from black roses that were watered with a golden watering

{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers","name":"Windflowers","description":"Windflowers are a common flower type, with three original colors and three hybrid colors.\n\nWhen two windflowers are planted adjacent to each other, the flowers might reproduce, and a new flower appears the following day in any of the spaces around the flowers. This new flower can be any of the two original colors, or a special hybrid color. Note that in order for this to happen, you need to water the flowers.\n\nTo maximize the chance of new flowers appearing, you should plant your flowers in a checkerboard pattern. This ensures the flowers are touching with many other flowers, while still leaving enough space for offspring to appear in.","imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_red.png","colors":[{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers:red","name":"Red Windflowers","colorName":"Red","flowerType":"Windflowers","price":40,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_red.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/icon/windflowers_red.png","colorName_EN-EU":"Red","colorName_DE":"Rot","colorName_ES":"Rojo","colorName_FR":"Rouge","colorName_IT":"Rossa","colorName_NL":"Rood","colorName_CH":"红色","colorName_CH-TR":"紅色","colorName_JP":"あかい","colorName_KR":"빨간","flowerType_EN-EU":"Windflowers","flowerType_DE":"Anemone","flowerType_ES":"Anémona","flowerType_FR":"Anémone","flowerType_IT":"Anemone","flowerType_NL":"Anemoon","flowerType_CH":"银莲花","flowerType_CH-TR":"銀蓮花","flowerType_JP":"アネモネ","flowerType_KR":"아네모네"},{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers:orange","name":"Orange Windflowers","colorName":"Orange","flowerType":"Windflowers","price":40,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_orange.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/icon/windflowers_orange.png","colorName_EN-EU":"Orange","colorName_DE":"Orange","colorName_ES":"Naraja","colorName_FR":"Orange","colorName_IT":"Arancione","colorName_NL":"Oranje","colorName_CH":"橘色","colorName_CH-TR":"橘色","colorName_JP":"オレンジ","colorName_KR":"오렌지색","flowerType_EN-EU":"Windflowers","flowerType_DE":"Anemone","flowerType_ES":"Anémona","flowerType_FR":"Anémone","flowerType_IT":"Anemone","flowerType_NL":"Anemoon","flowerType_CH":"银莲花","flowerType_CH-TR":"銀蓮花","flowerType_JP":"アネモネ","flowerType_KR":"아네모네"},{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers:white","name":"White Windflowers","colorName":"White","flowerType":"Windflowers","price":40,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_white.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/icon/windflowers_white.png","colorName_EN-EU":"White","colorName_DE":"Weiß","colorName_ES":"Blanco","colorName_FR":"Blanc","colorName_IT":"Bianca","colorName_NL":"Wit","colorName_CH":"白色","colorName_CH-TR":"白色","colorName_JP":"しろ","colorName_KR":"하얀","flowerType_EN-EU":"Windflowers","flowerType_DE":"Anemone","flowerType_ES":"Anémona","flowerType_FR":"Anémone","flowerType_IT":"Anemone","flowerType_NL":"Anemoon","flowerType_CH":"银莲花","flowerType_CH-TR":"銀蓮花","flowerType_JP":"アネモネ","flowerType_KR":"아네모네"},{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers:pink","name":"Pink Windflowers","colorName":"Pink","flowerType":"Windflowers","parents":"Red + Orange","price":80,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_pink.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/icon/windflowers_pink.png","colorName_EN-EU":"Pink","colorName_DE":"Pink","colorName_ES":"Rosa","colorName_FR":"Rose","colorName_IT":"Rosa","colorName_NL":"Roze","colorName_CH":"粉红","colorName_CH-TR":"粉紅","colorName_JP":"ピンク","colorName_KR":"핑크색","flowerType_EN-EU":"Windflowers","flowerType_DE":"Anemone","flowerType_ES":"Anémona","flowerType_FR":"Anémone","flowerType_IT":"Anemone","flowerType_NL":"Anemoon","flowerType_CH":"银莲花","flowerType_CH-TR":"銀蓮花","flowerType_JP":"アネモネ","flowerType_KR":"아네모네"},{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers:blue","name":"Blue Windflowers","colorName":"Blue","flowerType":"Windflowers","parents":"2x White / Orange + White","price":80,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_blue.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/icon/windflowers_blue.png","colorName_EN-EU":"Blue","colorName_DE":"Blau","colorName_ES":"Azul","colorName_FR":"Bleue","colorName_IT":"Blu","colorName_NL":"Blauw","colorName_CH":"蓝色","colorName_CH-TR":"藍色","colorName_JP":"あおい","colorName_KR":"파란","flowerType_EN-EU":"Windflowers","flowerType_DE":"Anemone","flowerType_ES":"Anémona","flowerType_FR":"Anémone","flowerType_IT":"Anemone","flowerType_NL":"Anemoon","flowerType_CH":"银莲花","flowerType_CH-TR":"銀蓮花","flowerType_JP":"アネモネ","flowerType_KR":"아네모네"},{"uuid":"v1:flower:windflowers:purple","name":"Purple Windflowers","colorName":"Purple","flowerType":"Windflowers","parents":"2x Blue / Blue + Pink","price":240,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/windflowers_purple.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/flower/icon/windflowers_purple.png","colorName_EN-EU":"Purple","colorName_DE":"Purpur","colorName_ES":"Violeta","colorName_FR":"Mauve","colorName_IT":"Indaco","colorName_NL":"Paars","colorName_CH":"紫色","colorName_CH-TR":"紫色","colorName_JP":"むらさき","colorName_KR":"보라색","flowerType_EN-EU":"Windflowers","flowerType_DE":"Anemone","flowerType_ES":"Anémona","flowerType_FR":"Anémone","flowerType_IT":"Anemone","flowerType_NL":"Anemoon","flowerType_CH":"银莲花","flowerType_CH-TR":"銀蓮花","flowerType_JP":"アネモネ","flowerType_KR":"아네모네"}]}
