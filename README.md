# @nook-world/data

> Static data used across nook.world applications

### Pre-Requisites

All `@nook-world` packages are published on GitHub. To use them in your application, it's recommended that you configure your npm client to always look for `@nook-world` packages on GitHub.

You can run the following command:

```bash
npm config set '@nook-world:registry' 'https://https://npm.pkg.github.com/'
```

This will make sure that, whenever you install something from the `@nook-world` namespace, it will look for it on GitHub.

You might need to configure a personal access token to download the packages. You can create one [clicking here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Github%20Packages&scopes=read:packages,write:packages).

After you create the token, you can execute the following command to save it to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken [YOUR TOKEN HERE]
```

You only have to do this once.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @nook-world/data
```

### Usage

```javascript
const bugs = require("@nook-world/bugs");
// => Array of all bugs
// => [{bug}, {bug}]
const Tarantula = require("@nook-world/bugs/Tarantula");
