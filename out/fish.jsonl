{"uuid":"v1:fish:coelacanth","name":"Coelacanth","rarity":5,"price":15000,"description":"Coelacanths are ancient fish once believed to be extinct but recently discovered around South Africa. Called \"living fossils,\" they have apparently changed very little over the past 400 million years. They can live for over 60 years and reach lengths of six feet but have rather small brains, even for fish. They have more fins and harder scales than the average fish, making them a rather resilient breed. Their flavour is very different from most fish, and they contain a fat that is indigestible by humans. It's for that second reason that eating them really isn't highly recommended.","location":"Sea (rainy days)","shadowSize":"huge","inGameOrder":80,"imageURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/fish/coelacanth.png","iconURL":"https://cdn.acnhtravelguide.app/fish/icon/coelacanth.png","higherAvailabilityInRain":"True","hoursAvailable":{"start":0,"end":23},"monthsAvailable":{"start":1,"end":12}}
